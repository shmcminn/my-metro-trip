# My Metro Work Trip

After I started using D.C.'s bus line instead of the Red Line (!), I became **overwhelmed** with all the options for how to get to work. The S9, the 43, the S4 -- which one to choose? 

The websites for looking at estimates weren't much help, and I realized it was just a logic problem once you get the data, so I took a shot at coding it into a Python script.

Example is in [bus_data.ipynb](bus_data.ipynb). Good next steps would be to get this into a tool where you can put in your own bus stops/routes and preferences for how long to wait for each one. At some point it would be cool to incorporate Google Maps walking times into it to figure out how far the stops are from your current location. 

Have fun!
